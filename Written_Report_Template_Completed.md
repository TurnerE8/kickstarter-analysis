# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project

  The project was a deep dive into crowdfunding data that allowed us to uncover various trends to aid in the fundraising process for a Kickstarter campaign. 

### Purpose
  The purpose of the project was to see if there was a relation between a fundraising campaign's launch date and their initial dollar amount goal. In this instance, we were performing analysis specifically in relation to theater fundraising.

## Analysis and Challenges
  I performed my analysis using a few different techniques and tools. The first of which was the usage of a pivot table to hone in on theater outcomes based on their launch date. In order to better visualize the findings, a line chart was created. 

  The second aspect of the project was analyzing outcomes based on the goal of the fundraising campaign. This was done by using a range of the various dollar amount goals and then seeing what percentages of successful and failed campaigns they were based on what range of fundraising goal they fell into. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
  By looking at the line chart for outcomes based on launch date, one instantly notices that campaigns launched during the months of April, May and June have the highest success rate in obtaining their goal. This remains true as one looks at the individual years by filtering the data using the pivot chart. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
  The fundraising outcome based on their initial goal reveals that campaigns with modest goals typically achieve their goal.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
  The biggest challenge I had during this project was developing the formula to make the ranges for the outcomes by goal analysis. I struggled adding the particular categories into the formula fields to get the result I wanted portrayed accurately. Additionally, this was a fairly large data set that required me narrowing it down to what applied to theaters and sometimes, more specifically, the plays subcategory. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
  1. Theaters that launched their campaigns during the months of April, May and June have a higher success rate in achieving their fundraising goal. 
  2. There are fewer theater campaign fundraisers as the season changes into winter. As one comes out of the seasonal months, there appears to be a trend that shows success for those launched during the month of February. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
  1. The number of projects that have a goal between 1000 dollars and 4999 dollars, based on how many there are, are on average more successful. This shows that the campaigns with modest fundraising goals will see more success.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
  I believe a look at what kind of marketing and/or fundraising strategies used would be a valuable piece of information to have. This would give us a better idea for how the fundraising was actually conducted. For those who are the most successful, WHAT was their approach to obtaining funding. 

  I also believe that additional information on where geographically these campaigns were being held - not just limited to country but looking at urban vs rural locations.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  A table showing the average donation per number of backers for the successful campaigns.
